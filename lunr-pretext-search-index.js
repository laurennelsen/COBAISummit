What film did the best (or the worst) in the United States and Canada?    Sort the films from largest to smallest using worlwide box office sales [insert column].    Highlight any movies that had a worldwide sales amount that is less than the average    Create a column for profit...      Now let's practice using Copilot in Excel to create data visualizations.      Create a scatter plot for budget vs. worldwide sales.    Create a line chart showing the number of films released each year.    Make a table showing how many films were rated G and PG.    How did average profit for G movies compare to average profit for PG movies?    Make a boxplot for the Rotten Tomatoes Score. Are there any outliers?         Create a confidence interval for the mean box_office_worldwide in column E.    Create a regression model to predict box_office_worldwide based on budget.    Is there an error? Why?    If you are able to use the response to create the model, how could you verify that it is correct?       "

However, it can still be helpful for providing guidance if we are not sure how to do something in Excel.  Use this link to open an Excel file in Office 365: Dentists by state  This data is from .

Dentist Geographic Heat Map  We want to create a geographic heat map showing the number of dentists per 100,000 residents in each state in the U.S. in 2021.     Ask Copilot to create a geographic heat map showing the number of dentists per 100,000 residents in each state in the U.S. in 2021.  Did it create a heat map?    Copilot probably did not create a heat map. Let's ask it how we would do it ourselves using the prompt below.   How do I create a geographic heat map for the number of dentists per 100,000 resident population in each state in 2021?   Follow the isntructions it gives to create the heat map.      "

  "body": " Using Generative AI to Create Data Visualizations   The analysis we can do and the visualizations we can create often depend on what version of a particular chatbot we are using. Some won't do much analysis with the free versions. (ChatGPT currently has Python incorporated into it and can do some of the analysis\/creating of visualizations using Python, but the free version is limited in what it will do in one day.)  In the examples below, think about what visualization would make sense to create to visualize some aspect(s) of the dataset.  Use either ChatGPT or Copilot to try to create that visualization. Think about the following questions as you view any images\/charts it creates:   Is the chart misleading in any way?    Is the chart accurate?    Is there anything notable that the generated chart\/image does not include?    Does the chart make sense? (Are axes labeled\/is it clear what is being shown?)        US Home Sales  The file NewHouseSalesUS.xls contains data for new, privately-owned, residential housing units sold and for sale in the United States between 2002 to the present.
