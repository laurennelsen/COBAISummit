Create a scatter plot for budget vs. worldwide sales.    Create a line chart showing the number of films released each year.    Make a table showing how many films were rated G and PG.    How did average profit for G movies compare to average profit for PG movies?    Make a boxplot for the Rotten Tomatoes Score. Are there any outliers?       Create a confidence interval for the mean box_office_worldwide in column E.    Create a regression model to predict box_office_worldwide based on budget.    Is there an error? Why?    If you are able to use the response to create the model, how could you verify that it is correct?      "

Is there anything notable that the generated description does not mention\/include?    Does the description make sense?     Also think about what other questions you have based on the description that is given.   Practice generating a description Choose (or create) a visualization of data that you want to describe.

  "body": " Using Generative AI to Create Data Visualizations   The analysis we can do and the visualizations we can create often depend on what version of a particular chatbot we are using. Some won't do much analysis with the free versions. (ChatGPT currently has Python incorporated into it and can do some of the analysis\/creating of visualizations using Python, but the free version is limited in what it will do in one day.)  In the examples below, think about what visualization would make sense to create to visualize some aspect(s) of the dataset. (It might help to ask some questions about the data before deciding what visualization to create.)  Use either ChatGPT or Copilot to try to create that visualization. Think about the following questions as you view any images\/charts it creates:   Is the chart misleading in any way?    Is the chart accurate?    Is there anything notable that the generated chart\/image does not include?    Does the chart make sense? (Are axes labeled\/is it clear what is being shown?)       2024 Paris Olympics The file below contains data for medalists in the 2024 Paris Olympics.
