  <title>Using Generative AI to Describe a Data Visualization</title>


<example>
    <p>
        Choose (or create) a visualization of data that you want to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
       Use either ChatGPT or Copilot to generate a description of the image.  Think about the following questions after generating the description:
       <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                (Is the image you used misleading in any way?)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Is the description accurate?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Is there anything notable that the generated description does not mention/include?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Does the description make sense?
            </p>
        </li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you aren't sure what image to use, here are some that you can try:
        <ul>

            <li>
                <p>
                    
                </p>
            </li>



            <li>
                <p>
                    <image source="MonarchSankey.png" width="60%"/> <fn>This image is from the budgeting software <em>Monarch</em>.</fn>
                </p>
            </li>
          



        </ul>
    </p>
