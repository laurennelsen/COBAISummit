    <title>Sankey Chart Using Viz Extension</title>
    
    <p>
        We want to use Tableau to create a Sankey chart for the 2023 NBA playoff data below to get an image like the one shown.
    </p>
    <p>
         <url href="external/sheets/2023NBAPlayoffs.xlsx" />
    </p>
    <p>
         <image source="NBASankey.png" width="100%"></image>


    </p>

    <p>
        Here is a link where you can access a Tableau workbook connected to this Excel file and edit it in Tableau Public:

    </p>
