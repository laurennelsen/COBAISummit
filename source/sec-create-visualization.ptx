  <title>Using Generative AI to Create Data Visualizations</title>

<introduction>
    <p>
    The analysis we can do and the visualizations we can create often depend on what version of a particular chatbot we are using.  Some won't do much analysis with the free versions.  (ChatGPT currently has Python incorporated into it and can do some of the analysis/creating of visualizations using Python, but the free version is limited in what it will do in one day.)
</p>

 <p>
        In the examples below, think about what visualization would make sense to create to visualize some aspect(s) of the dataset.  (It might help to ask some questions about the data before deciding what visualization to create.)
    </p>
    <p>
       Use either ChatGPT or Copilot to try to create that visualization.  Think about the following questions as you view any images/charts it creates:
       <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Is the chart misleading in any way?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Is the chart accurate?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Is there anything notable that the generated chart/image does not include?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Does the chart make sense?  (Are axes labeled/is it clear what is being shown?)
            </p>
        </li>
       </ul>
       </p>

        Think about what type of chart you would want to use to visualize the data and try to use either ChatGPT or Copilot to create a visualization of the data.

    <p>
        The file below contains data for medalists in the 2024 Paris Olympics.<fn>This data is from <url href="https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2024/" /></fn></p>

        <p>
            Think about what visualizations would make sense to create with this data and create visualizations for a few different aspects of the data.

                        <p>
                            Make a histogram showing the number of homes sold in each price range in a given year.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Make a line chart showing how the number of homes in the <m>\$300,000</m> to <m>\$399,000</m> price range has changed from 2002 to 2022.
                        </p>
